## React Native Bug: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native: attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized. This often leads to unexpected behavior or crashes. The `Bug.js` file showcases the error, and `BugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.

### How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the `Bug.js` component and the corrected behavior in `BugSolution.js`.

### Bug Description

The issue arises when accessing the `data` state variable immediately in the `render` method of a functional component. At the initial render, the state is `null` or undefined, which causes an error when we try to access `data.length`. 

### Solution

The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to ensure that the asynchronous operation to fetch data is complete before rendering the component. Also, we use conditional rendering to display a loading indicator or error message if the data hasn't loaded yet. This prevents the error and provides a better user experience.
